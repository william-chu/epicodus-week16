## Component Structure

![Component Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/william-chu/epicodus-week16/master/component_structure.png)

## Development Issues
* Not sure how I should structure the form without knowing about state
* Responsive styling was not as intuitive using jsx style tags and components
* First attempt to publish to gh-pages did not work

## Angular vs React Observations

* React combines styling and markup into one component
